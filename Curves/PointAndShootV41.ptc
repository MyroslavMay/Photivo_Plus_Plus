; photivo Curve File
;
; This is a good replacement curve for photographers who constantly
; find themselves having to use EV compensation to correct for dark 
; images. It is calibrated to add the equivalent of +0.5 EV to images 
; while holding more highlight information than if you were to actually
; set the camera to +0.5 EV. This curve is recommended for most users 
; as a general use curve.;
